# Stacking Game

## Rules
Player counts: 2-4

There are 32 pieces, split into 2 colors, red and black (or blue).
All pieces are divided equally among each player.

We can call for single, double, triple, or 4 or 5 (soldiers only) pieces. Whoever has the better pieces gets all of them and gets stacked into 1/2/3/4/5 column(s) with current players still surviving.

Player that lost all their pieces got eliminated.
